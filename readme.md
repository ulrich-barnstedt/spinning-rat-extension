# Spinning rat extension
_Spinning rats, everywhere._


**Two versions of this extension exist:**
 - Normal version: Will try to insert the GIF anywhere on the page, is relatively error-prone
 - Image version: Will replace a random image on the page with the GIF, is not as error-prone and more stable

Recommended is the image version, this may however interfere with your browsing experience.


## Installation

1. Open extension settings
2. Enable developer mode
3. Click `Load unpacked`
4. Select either the `rat-img` or `rat-normal` folder.
5. Spin rats
